Intro

Front-end performance bottle necks often fall into two categories:<br/><br/>

1) external requests<br/>
    - loading scripts, images, etc<br/>
    - XHR requests (loading data from server, communicating with 3rd party APIs, etc)<br/>
2) computationally expensive code<br/>
    - iterating over a large dataset<br/>
    - working with file data<br/>
